NOTE: WINVER has been defined as 0x0500 or greater which enables
Windows NT 5.0 and Windows 98 features. When these headers were released,
Windows NT 5.0 beta 1 and Windows 98 beta 2.1 were the current versions.

For this release when WINVER is defined as 0x0500 or greater, you can only
build beta or test applications.  To build a retail application,
set WINVER to 0x0400 or visit http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk
to see if retail Windows NT 5.0 or Windows 98 headers are available.

See the SDK release notes for more information.
